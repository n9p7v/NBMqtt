# NBMqtt

This library allows an [Arduino MKR NB 1500](https://docs.arduino.cc/hardware/mkr-nb-1500) board to connect and publish data to an MQTT broker utilizing u-blox [SARA-R4](https://www.u-blox.com/en/product/sara-r4-series?legacy=Current#Documentation-&-resources) AT commands.

It serves as an extension and relies on the [MKRNB library](https://github.com/arduino-libraries/MKRNB) for its functionality.
